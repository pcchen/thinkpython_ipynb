      "  Hint: The exterior angles of an n-sided regular polygon are 360/n degrees.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Write a function called `circle` that takes a turtle, `t`, and radius, `r`, as parameters and that draws an approximate circle by invoking polygon with an appropriate length and number of sides. Test your function with a range of values of `r`.\n",

      "5. Make a more general version of `circle` called `arc` that takes an additional parameter angle, which determines what fraction of a circle to draw. `angle` is in units of degrees, so when `angle=360`, `arc` should draw a complete circle."
